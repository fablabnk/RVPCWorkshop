# About the RVPC project

The [Olimex RVPC](https://github.com/OLIMEX/RVPC) is modern RISC-V mini-computer with retro VGA monitor and PS/2 keyboard connection. It is an educational platform which people can use to learn RISC-V assembler and experiment like in the old days in 1980s :) We are using it in the fablab of our coding school (42 Berlin)[https://www.42berlin.de] as a low-cost way to teach open hardware, soldering and to create monochrome info-display screens at the congress.
